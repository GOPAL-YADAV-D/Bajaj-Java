You are helping me build a Spring Boot application based on these requirements. Generate clean, production-ready Java + Spring Boot code following SOLID principles and proper packaging.

**Goal:**  
Build a Spring Boot app that automatically runs a workflow when the application starts (no REST controller triggers).  

**Flow:**

1. On app startup, send a POST request:

   URL:
   https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/generateWebhook/JAVA

   JSON Body:
   {
      "name": "Gopal Yadav",
      "regNo": "22BCT0094",
      "email": "gopalyadav6560@gmail.com"
   }

2. Parse the response JSON. It will contain:
   - `webhookUrl`
   - `accessToken`

3. Based on the last two digits of the `regNo`:
   - If odd → Question 1 URL to fetch:
     https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAPx2to9zmN5DY0tkMrJRNvJrNVx1gnR/view
   - If even → Question 2 URL to fetch:
     https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b0p5C-6fUrUQglJVaWWAAB3P12lfoBCH/view

4. Parse/process logic so that the program forms the final SQL query string. 
   (For now mock/fake the logic with a placeholder SQL string.)

5. Send a second POST request:

   URL:
   https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/testWebhook/JAVA

   Headers:
   Authorization: <accessToken>
   Content-Type: application/json

   Body:
   {
      "finalQuery": "<the_SQL_query>"
   }

**Tech & Implementation Requirements:**

- Use Spring Boot 3+
- Use `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` (preferred)
- No controllers for triggering flow — run logic using:
  - `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner`
- Use proper service, config, and model layering.
- Log the request/response cleanly.
- Add error handling + retry strategy for network calls.
- Write tests using JUnit + Mockito.
- Generate a working runnable `.jar`.

Now generate:

1. Project structure recommendations
2. Full working code (main app, services, DTOs, config)
3. A sample test file
